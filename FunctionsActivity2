# Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number (a non-negative integer n ). The function accepts the number as an argument.
# The factorial of a number is the product of all the integers from 1 to that number and it is represented by n!
# The factorial is not defined for negative numbers, and the factorial of zero is one, 0! = 1.
# import math Library
import math


# create function where n represents the number to be factorised
def function_factorial(n):
    # condition to check if number is non-negative
    # if negative, it will be rejected
    if n < 0:
        print("Only positive number accepted")
    # if equal to 0, result is 1
    elif n == 0:
        print(1)
    # if other number, function will go on with formula which will hits all the integers from 1 to that number
    else:
        # return factorial of a number
        # the function will exit with total value
        print(math.factorial(n))
        
# calling the function
function_factorial(6)
