# Write a Python program to calculate the average value of a list elements.
# Sample List:
# [20, 30, 25, 35, -16, 60, -100]
# creating a list from the instructions
numbers = [20, 30, 25, 35, -16, 60, -100]
# determining the numbers of items in the list by using len()
length = len(numbers)
# using the sum() function to return the number from adding the numbers in the list
addedNumbers = sum(numbers)
# dividing the total from the sum by the number of items in the list and rounding the number to one decimal with round()
total = round(addedNumbers / length, 1)
# printing the result as the expected output
print(f"Average value of the list elements is {total}.")
# Expected output:
# Average value of the list elements is : 7.7.
