# Write a Python program that accepts three numbers from the user and prints "Increasing order" if the numbers are in
# the increasing order, "Decreasing order" if the numbers are in the decreasing order
# and "Neither increasing nor decreasing order" otherwise.
# Input first number: 1524 Input second number: 2345 Input third number: 3321
# Expected Output : Increasing order.

# Take input from the user for the first number
first_number = int(input("Input the first number: "))
# Take input from the user for the second number
second_number = int(input("Input the second number: "))
# Take input from the user for the third number
third_number = int(input("Input the second number: "))
# Writing a statement to verity conditions and printing the accurate sentence
# if statement with if keyword to check if all numbers are in ascending order
if first_number < second_number < third_number:
    print("Increasing number")
# elif statement if first statement returns false and verify if numbers are in decreasing order
elif first_number > second_number > third_number:
    print("Decreasing number")
# else statement if neither if nor elif are true
else:
    print("Neither increasing nor decreasing")
