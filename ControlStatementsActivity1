# Write a Python program that accepts three numbers and prints "All numbers are equal" if all three numbers are equal,
# "All numbers are different" if all three numbers are different and "Neither all are equal nor different" otherwise.
# Test Data:
# Input first number: 2
# Input second number: 3
# Input third number: 4
# Expected Output : All numbers are different.

# Take input from the user for the first number
first_number = int(input("Input the first number: "))

# Take input from the user for the second number
second_number = int(input("Input the second number: "))

# Take input from the user for the third number
third_number = int(input("Input the second number: "))
# Writing a statement to verity conditions and printing the accurate sentence
if first_number == second_number == third_number:  # if statement with if keyword to check if all numbers are the same
    print("All numbers are equal")
elif first_number != second_number != third_number:  # elif statement to verify second condition if first one is false
    print("All numbers are different")
else:  # else statement if neither if or elif are true
    print("Neither all are equal nor different")
