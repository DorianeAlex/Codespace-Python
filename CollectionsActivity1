# Write a Python program to sum values of a list.
# Sample List:
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
# creating a list from the instructions
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
# using the sum() function to return the number from adding the numbers in the list
total = sum(numbers)
# printing the result as the expected output
print(f"The sum is {total}.")
# Expected output:
# The sum is 55.
