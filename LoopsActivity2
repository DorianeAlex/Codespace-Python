# Write a Python program to create the multiplication table (from 1 to 10) of a number.
# Expected Output:
# Input a number: 6

# ask the user to input a number
number = int(input("Choose a number"))
# print a line to introduce the purpose of the exercise
print(f"Here is the multiplication table of {number}")
# starting a while loop to start from 0 and finish by 10
i = 0
while i <= 10:
    # print the result with operation needed
    print(f"{number} x {i} = {number * i}")
    # increasing by one each time the while loop is run and stopping when reaching 10
    i += 1
