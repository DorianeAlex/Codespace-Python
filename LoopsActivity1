# Write a Python program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 and 50.
# The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers : 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ....

# Initialize the first two Fibonacci numbers
a = 0
b = 1

# Print the initial number
print("The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers: ")

# writing a while loop to generate the Fibonacci series
# putting a limit to the result, the loop stops if the result is above 50
while a <= 50:
    # the end command allow to display the result of numbers on the same line
    print(a, end=', ')
    # every next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.
    # by writing the line at the end, it allows to print the result starting by 0 if not it would start by 1
    a, b = b, a + b
